# AI Music Generation for GDG Competition

Welcome to the AI Music Generation project, developed for the GDG competition. This project leverages artificial intelligence techniques to create original music compositions.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to explore the capabilities of AI in the field of music generation. By utilizing machine learning models, the project aims to produce unique and coherent musical pieces.

## Features

- **AI-Generated Music**: Employs advanced algorithms to compose music.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to input parameters to influence the generated music.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual representations of the generated music patterns.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raj-jaiswal/AI-Music-Gen.git
   ```
îˆ†

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd AI-Music-Gen
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To generate music using the AI model:

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook GDG.ipynb
   ```

2. **Follow the Instructions**:

   Open the `GDG.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells in sequence. Provide any required inputs as prompted to generate your unique music piece.
